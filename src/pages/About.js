            Background as a cognitive psychologist, so Iâ€™m all about the
            user-experience. With passion to build and design web applications

            spaces that will help us manage ourselves, share knowledge, and
            build together sustainable communities. So, I started to learn how
            to code:) First with the help of the wonderful community SHECODES,
            but mostly self-taut. About a half-year ago or more, I finished a
            front-end development course, then took an internship, and continued
            to educate myself with new technologies that I praioteriez (so much
            to choose from){' '}
